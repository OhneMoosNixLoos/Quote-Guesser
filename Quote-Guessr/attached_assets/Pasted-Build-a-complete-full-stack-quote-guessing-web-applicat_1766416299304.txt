Build a complete full-stack quote guessing web application using Node.js + Express for the backend and vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend.
The app must be responsive, beginner-friendly, and well-structured.

🧠 App Concept

The user sees a quote and must guess who said it.
The app includes three difficulty levels:

Easy Mode

Show one quote

Display 4 answer buttons

1 correct author, 3 incorrect authors

Shuffle answers each time

Medium Mode

Show quote

User must type the author name

Use fuzzy matching (case-insensitive, allow small typos)

Accept last name only if unambiguous

Hard Mode

Show quote

User must type exact author name

Very strict matching (trim spaces only)

🏗️ Backend Requirements

Use Node.js with Express

Create REST API endpoints:

GET /api/quote?difficulty=easy|medium|hard
POST /api/check


Store quotes in a local JSON file:

{
  "id": 1,
  "text": "Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.",
  "author": "John Lennon",
  "difficulty": "easy"
}


Backend responsibilities:

Select random quote by difficulty

Generate incorrect authors for easy mode

Validate answers

Return correct/incorrect feedback

Implement session-based score tracking

🎨 Frontend Requirements

Clean, modern UI

Mobile-first responsive layout

Components:

Quote display

Difficulty selector

Answer buttons (easy)

Text input (medium/hard)

Submit button

Feedback message

Score counter

Frontend must:

Fetch quotes from backend

Submit answers

Show result instantly

Load next quote automatically

🧪 Matching Logic

Medium mode:

Normalize input (lowercase, remove punctuation)

Allow Levenshtein distance ≤ 2

Hard mode:

Exact match after trimming whitespace

🧩 Extra Features

Randomize quotes without repetition per session

Display progress (question X / 10)

Restart game button

📚 Documentation

Comment all important code sections

Explain how to run the app

Explain how to extend the quote database

⚠️ Constraints

Do NOT use frameworks like React or Vue

Do NOT use external APIs

Must run with:

npm install
node server.js


Deliver a fully working app ready to run in Replit.
